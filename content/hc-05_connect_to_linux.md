Summary: Connect Bluetooth HC-05 module to Linux PC using Arduino Nano for
configuration
Lang: en
Image: images/hc-05.jpg

Bluetooth on Linux has always been a headache for me. As I expected connecting
HC-05 module to my laptop wasn't any better. In this note I want to describe
how to configure and connect [HC-05 Bluetooth module][1] to the Linux PC.

Playing with these cheap (about `3$`) Bluetooth modules I wrote a small
application which can help to diagnose and configure them. In this article I use
Arduino Nano (atmega328p) and calssical HC-05 with a linear power regulator.
There is no need to solder anything complicated - only one little wire üòÄ.

Firstly, let me describe this Arduino app. I can't say that it is very reliable
but it is simpler than doing everything by hand.

### [`HCTOOLS`][3] - Arduino application

This application can be used on most of the Arduinos starting from Arduino Nano.
You can download it from the [Github][3]. I used [platformio][2] as a development
environment so if you familiar with it you know what to do (look into
`platformio.ini`). If not you can use classical Arduino IDE. To do so you need
to:

1. Copy content of `src/main.cpp` into Arduino IDE
2. Install `SoftwareSerial` and `SimpleCLI` libraries with library manager
3. Upload the sketch.

The application provides "shell"-like interface to work with HC-05 module. It
has following commands/features:

* **echo** - run echo server. It is useful to check if your module is working.
  You run this command, connect to the module with your phone or PC and start
  sending some text to it. The module will receive the text, send it to Arduino,
  Arduino will send it back to the module and then module will send it back to
  you. 
* **atmode** - switch HC-05 into AT command mode.  The Arduino will just into
  serial passtrhogh device between your PC and HC-05. This allow you to
  communicate with Bluetooth module without any additional hardware (with the
  exception of Arduino of course). You can test if it works by sending `AT`
  command which should be answered with `OK`.
* **master <MAC-of-slave\> <name\>** - configure connected HC-05 module as
  Bluetooth master. It has two parameters. The first one is MAC address of the
  bluetooth device to which you want your module to connect immediately after
  boot. Note that MAC address should be in the following form `1234:12:123456` -
  not like classical one with lot of `:`. The second parameter is just Bluetooth
  name of your HC-05 module. Pretty useful to distinguish it from other HC-05
  slaves.
* **slave <name\>** - configure connected HC-05 module as Bluetooth slave. The
  same as for master you can configured name of the module.
* **name <name\>** - change Bluetooth name of the module. 
* **baudrate <baudrate\>** - change baudrate of the module. This baudrate is used when
  module communicates with Arduino.

To use it firstly you need to connect your Arduino and HC-05 module together.

**Hardware Setup**. The Arduino will need to control power to the HC-05 module
and be able to set HIGH/LOW state on the pin 34 (or PIO11). This is required due
to the way HC-05 is switched to AT mode. Firstly, Arduino powers off the module
then it sets pin 34 into HIGH state and turns power on. After this HC-05 boot
into AT mode.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img id="schematics" class="image" alt="Schematics of connection of HC-05 Bluetooth module and Arduino" style="max-height: 400px;" src="{static}/images/008-schematics.png">
</div>

The transistor can be any PNP transistor from your Arduino kit. Make sure that
it is PNP by googling its datasheet. I used `2N3906`. The resistor also can
vary. It is needed to limit current going through the base of the transistor. I
picked 1000 Ohm one. I suppose that anything around 500 - 1500 Ohm would work.

**Let's try this out!** Connect Arduino and HC-05 as shown in the schematics
above and flash the application to the Arduino (with [platformio][2] or Arduino
IDE). Then open serial monitor. You should see something like this:

```console
HCTOOLS. Version: 1.0 (f0341d1)
# 
```

By default application assumes that module has baudrate set to `38400` (the
default baudrate in AT mode). If you changed it previously then change it in the
application as well and re-upload it.

Type `help` into the application shell to see all the available commands.

### Back to PC

So, after you set name for your module and configure it as a slave you can try
to setup wireless connection. Install Bluetooth stack:

```console
$ sudo apt-get install bluez bluez-utils
```

Next, lets check if kernel module is installed and loaded. For some chips it
will be enough to have `btusb` loaded but for other chips (like my Broadcom)
you will need to find and install appropriate driver. You can check if `btusb`
is loaded into the kernel by the following command:

```console
$ lsmod | grep btusb
btusb                  65536  0
btrtl                  24576  1 btusb
btbcm                  16384  1 btusb
btintel                32768  1 btusb
bluetooth             675840  5 btrtl,btintel,btbcm,btusb
```
<p class="note-right">
<span class="note-sign">Note:</span> 
In case you also have <code>Broadcom</code> chip I would recommend to look into
this <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/632336/bluetooth-broadcom-43142-isnt-working/632348#632348">instruction</a>. It seems to be a common solution.
</p>

If there is nothing in the output you should try to install general Bluetooth
driver:

```console
$ sudo apt-get install btusb
```

If it won't work try to find driver for your particular device. You can find out
some information about name of your Bluetooth chip with following commands:

```console
$ lsusb | grep Bluetooth
... output is hidden ...
$ dmesg | grep Bluetooth
... output is hidden ...
```

After driver is installed and kernel module is loaded start and enable Bluetooth
service:

```console
$ sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service
$ sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service
```

Check that service successfully started:

```console
$ sudo systemctl status bluetooth.service
    ‚óè bluetooth.service - Bluetooth service
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
     Active: active (running) since Thu 2020-02-20 19:35:07 CET; 23h ago
       Docs: man:bluetoothd(8)
   Main PID: 779 (bluetoothd)
      Tasks: 1 (limit: 6990)
     Memory: 2.7M
     CGroup: /system.slice/bluetooth.service
             ‚îî‚îÄ779 /usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd
```
<p class="note-left">
<span class="note-sign">Note:</span> There should be:<br><code>Active: active (running)</code>
</p>

Now, if you installed your driver reset your PC/laptop. It should not be reboot
but power reset (power off -> power on) because during reboot your drivers could
still stay unloaded (you know just in case). After boot check output of
`dmesg` it should be something similar to this:

```console
$ dmesg | grep Bluetooth

[    6.505851] Bluetooth: hci0: Broadcom Bluetooth Device (43142)
```

### Pairing with the device

First of all, I always try to connect to the HC-05 with Android phone. I used
[Serial Bluetooth Terminal][10] to connect and send some text to the module to
check that it alive. It always a good sign if everything going well. So, in case
you have one try that. Anyway, in the linux run `bluetoothctl`:

```console
$ sudo bluetoothctl
Agent registered
[CHG] Controller 80:56:F2:E5:43:E6 Pairable: yes
[bluetooth]# 
```

Make power reset of the HC-05 module and then turn on scanning on your PC:

```console
[bluetooth]# power on
Changing power on succeeded
[bluetooth]# scan on
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller 80:56:F2:E5:43:E6 Discovering: yes
[CHG] Device 78:BD:BC:D3:D5:68 RSSI: -92
[CHG] Device 78:BD:BC:D3:D5:68 Name: [TV] UE40J6272
[CHG] Device 78:BD:BC:D3:D5:68 Alias: [TV] UE40J6272
[CHG] Device 00:13:EF:00:03:04 RSSI: -59
```

The exact MAC address of the HC-05 can be obtained by the `AT+ADDR?` command in
the `atmode`. 

After something like HC-05 (`00:13:EF:00:03:04` in my case) will appear on the
screen you will need to make it trustworthy, pair it with your PC and try to
connect to it. That can be done by the following commands `trust <MAC>`, `pair
<MAC>` and `connect <MAC>` accordingly.

```console
[bluetooth]# trust 00:13:EF:00:03:04
[CHG] Device 00:13:EF:00:03:04 Trusted: yes
Changing 00:13:EF:00:03:04 trust succeeded
[bluetooth]# pair 00:13:EF:00:03:04
Attempting to pair with 00:13:EF:00:03:04
Request PIN code
[agent] Enter PIN code: 1234

[CHG] Device 00:13:EF:00:03:04 ServicesResolved: yes
[CHG] Device 00:13:EF:00:03:04 Paired: yes
Pairing successful
[bluetooth]# set-alias mymodule
[CHG] Device 00:13:EF:00:03:04 Alias: mymodule
Changing mymodule succeeded
[bluetooth]# connect mymodule
Device mymodule not available
[CHG] Device 00:13:EF:00:03:04 ServicesResolved: no
[CHG] Device 00:13:EF:00:03:04 Connected: no
[CHG] Device 00:13:EF:00:03:04 Connected: yes
[mymodyle]# 
```

If you'd like to check if disconnect works:

```console
[mymodule]# disconnect
Attempting to disconnect from 00:13:EF:00:03:04
Successful disconnected
[CHG] Device 00:13:EF:00:03:04 Connected: no
[bluetooth]# 
```

### Time to open serial monitor

The last step is to create serial port. The following command binds your
Bluetooth device with rfcomm device (`/dev/rmcomm0` in this case). It won't
immediately connect to your HC-05 only when an application such as serial
monitor will use it. More about [RFCOMM protocol and devices][6].

Unfortunately, on some systems (e.g. Arch linux) `rfcomm` utility can be in
status "deprecated" and won't be available in the official repository. Try to
find instruction of how to install it on your particular system (See [Arch
Wiki][9]). 

```console
    $ sudo rfcomm bind rfcomm0 <MAC-OF-HC-05>
```

Now you should have serial port `/dev/rmcomm0` which is attached to your
Bluetooth device. 

Let's test that it works. In another terminal open serial monitor attached to
Arduino with `HCTOOLS` application and run `echo` command:

```console
    $ pio -e nano -t monitor
    ...some output is hidden...
    --- Miniterm on /dev/ttyUSB0  115200,8,N,1 ---
    --- Quit: Ctrl+C | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---
    HCTOOLS. Version: 1.0
    # echo
    Echoing every received character. CTRL-D to stop it.
```

Try to open serial monitor on this port and communicate with device:

```console
    $ pio device monitor -p /dev/rfcomm0 -b 115200
    ...long output is hidden...
    --- Miniterm on /dev/ttyUSB0  115200,8,N,1 ---
    --- Quit: Ctrl+C | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---
    Hello
```

Now, if you send something to Arduino it will send it to HC-05 and then to your
`/dev/rfcomm0` port. If you will send something to the `/dev/rfcomm0` with a
newline it will send it back to you.

#### Troubleshooting

There is list of problems which I faced during my attempts to configure
everything right.

1. The following messages in response to  `rfcomm bind` command probably means
   that you don't have kernel module for RFCOMM protocol. Try to load it `sudo
   modprobe rfcomm`. Also try to update the kernel.

    ```
        Can't open RFCOMM control socket: Protocol not supported 
    ```

2. If `bluetoothctl` shows `No default controller available` make sure that you
   have your driver installed and then run `bluetoothctl` with `sudo`
   ([stackoverflow answer][7]).

3. It can happen that other application is using Bluetooth and by doing so it
   will occupy Bluetooth controller (in my case it was `connman`). You can
   unblock it by firstly stopping the suspected application and then running
   following command `rfkill unblock all`:

        $ sudo rfkill list
        0: tpacpi_bluetooth_sw: Bluetooth
            Soft blocked: no
            Hard blocked: no
        1: hci0: Bluetooth
            Soft blocked: yes
            Hard blocked: no
        5: phy3: Wireless LAN
            Soft blocked: no
            Hard blocked: no
        $ sudo rfkill unblock all
        $ sudo rfkill list
        ...
        1: hci0: Bluetooth
            Soft blocked: no
            Hard blocked: no
        ...

4. As always power on/off helped in a few cases üòÄ.
5. A lot of information about Bluetooth is available on the [Arch Linux Wiki][8]
