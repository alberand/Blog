Summary: Development setup for Linux kernel on NixOS
Lang: en

NixOS is quite flexible in creating VM. Basically, you can write nix
configuration for a system and build it as VM with a command. As Nix allows to
do anything with the system you can easily add any packages, systemd services,
disks, files etc. 

There are a few disadvantages, however, which could be worked out by a few
hacks. For example, as Nix is always tries to do a clean build it will recompile
your kernel everytime you change it. This is super inconvenient even for a
minimal configuration. However, there is two ways to work around this.

### Full configuration

To compile:

```console
nix-build '<nixpkgs/nixos>' -A vm --arg configuration ./vm.nix
```

To run:

```console
./result/bin/run-nixos-vm
```

Configuration:

```nix
{ config, modulesPath, pkgs, lib, ... }: let

# Custom local xfstests
xfstests-overlay = (self: super: {
	xfstests = super.xfstests.overrideAttrs (prev: {
		version = "git";
		src = fetchGit /home/alberand/xfstests-dev;
	});
});

# Custom remote xfstests
xfstests-overlay-remote = (self: super: {
	xfstests = super.xfstests.overrideAttrs (prev: {
		version = "git";
		src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
			owner = "alberand";
			repo = "xfstests";
			rev = "6e6fb1c6cc619afb790678f9530ff5c06bb8f24c";
			sha256 = "OjkO7wTqToY1/U8GX92szSe7mAIL+61NoZoBiU/pjPE=";
		};
	});
});

kernel-custom = pkgs.linuxKernel.customPackage { 
	# Note that nix uses this version to install relevant tools (e.g. flex).
	# You can specify 'git' not to change it every time you change the verions
	# but I haven't got it working properly. Nix will tell you which version
	# you should specify if you don't know.
	version = "6.2.0-rc2";
	configfile = /home/alberand/kernel/.config;
	src = fetchGit /home/alberand/kernel;
};

in
{
	imports = [ 
		(modulesPath + "/profiles/qemu-guest.nix") 
		(modulesPath + "/virtualisation/qemu-vm.nix")
	];

	boot = {
		kernelParams = ["console=ttyS0,115200n8" "console=ttyS0"];
		consoleLogLevel = lib.mkDefault 7;
		# This is happens before systemd
		postBootCommands = "echo 'Not much to do before systemd :)' > /dev/kmsg";
		crashDump.enable = true;

		# Set my custom kernel
		# kernelPackages = kernel-custom;
	};

	# Auto-login with empty password
	users.extraUsers.root.initialHashedPassword = "";
	services.getty.autologinUser = lib.mkDefault "root";

	networking.firewall.enable = false;
	networking.hostName = "vm";
	networking.useDHCP = false;

		wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
		script = ''
			echo 'This service runs right near login' > /dev/kmsg
		'';
	};

	# Setup envirionment
	environment.variables.TERM = "xterm";

	virtualisation = {
		diskSize = 20000; # MB
		memorySize = 4096; # MB
		cores = 4;
		writableStoreUseTmpfs = false;

		qemu = {

				#"-kernel /home/user/my-linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage"

				# Append real partitions to VM

				# "-hdd /dev/sda5"

				"-serial mon:stdio"
			];

			# Append images as partition to VM
			# Don't forget to create images. For example, with:
			#   xfs_io -f -c "falloc 0 10g" test.img
			# OR much slower version:
			#   dd if=/dev/null of=test.img bs=4k count=2450
			drives = [
				#{ name = "vdc"; file = "${toString ./test.img}"; }
				#{ name = "vdb"; file = "${toString ./scratch.img}"; }
			];
		};

		sharedDirectories = {
			# fstests = { 
			#	source = "/home/alberand/Projects/xfstests-dev";
			#	target = "/root/xfstests"; 
			# };
		};
	};

	# Add packages to VM
	environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
		htop
			util-linux
			xfstests
			vim
			tmux
			fsverity-utils
			trace-cmd
			perf-tools
			linuxPackages_latest.perf
			openssl
	];


	# Apply overlay on the package (use different src as we replaced 'src = ')
	nixpkgs.overlays = [ 
		xfstests-overlay-remote
	];

	# xfstests related
	users.users.paul = {
		isNormalUser  = true;
		description  = "Test user";
	};

	# This value determines the NixOS release from which the default
	# settings for stateful data, like file locations and database versions
	# on your system were taken. Itâ€˜s perfectly fine and recommended to leave
	# this value at the release version of the first install of this system.
	# Before changing this value read the documentation for this option
	# (e.g. man configuration.nix or on https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html).
	system.stateVersion = "22.11"; # Did you read the comment?
}
```

#### The simplest VM

Create a directory and a simple vm.nix with following content:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:
{
	imports = [ 
		<nixpkgs/nixos/modules/profiles/qemu-guest.nix>
		<nixpkgs/nixos/modules/virtualisation/qemu-vm.nix>
	];

	# Root with empty password
	users.extraUsers.root.password = "";
	users.mutableUsers = false;

	system.stateVersion = "22.11";
}
```

I also suggest to `git init .` to not loose any progress. That's actually enough
to get a working VM. Compile it as follows:

```console
nix-build '<nixpkgs/nixos>' -A vm --arg configuration ./vm.nix
```

The command above will take quite some time, especially compiling the kernel.
Eventually `nix-build` creates a `./result` directory. The directory contains
shell script to run VM:

```console
./result/bin/run-nixos-vm
```

To exit from the VM type `poweroff` command or `CTRL + A` followed by `X`
to kill Qemu. I recommend to use `poweroff` as disk image can get corrupted and
your guest system won't boot (fix by removing the image and running VM again).

#### Customize packages/derivations

The `let` section above contains a few derivation overlays. In Nix derivation is
a package and overlay is like patch to the package. With overlay you can change
sources, version, metadata, build flags etc.

In the following example the sources of the `xfstests` derivation points to
local repository. The `xfstests` derivation is already defined in NixOS packages
store. We don't need to define how to build and install scripts.

```nix
# Custom local xfstests
xfstests-overlay = (self: super: {
    xfstests = super.xfstests.overrideAttrs (prev: {
        version = "git";
        src = fetchGit /home/alberand/xfstests-dev;
    });
});
```

The `super` keyword is like input for our overlay. In this case `super` points
to `pkgs`. The `self` keyword is like output for our overlay. In this example
output is not used directly. 

This overlay takes `xfstests` derivation from the inputs and replaces `version`
and `src` parameters of the derivation. When derivation is build new parameters
will be used. The version can be exact major.minor or just git for not tagged
git tree.

#### Custom Kernel and .config

Linux Kernel is also provided as derivation and has many helpful derivation
already in store. To build kernel from your local source tree with local
`.config` define following package in the `let` section:

```nix
kernel-custom = pkgs.linuxKernel.customPackage { 
    # Note that nix uses this version to install relevant tools (e.g. flex).
    # You can specify 'git' not to change it every time you change the verions
    # but I haven't got it working properly. Nix will tell you which version
    # you should specify if you don't know.
    version = "6.2.0-rc2";
    configfile = /home/alberand/kernel/.config;
    src = fetchGit /home/alberand/kernel;
};
```

and then set this package as default kernel in the config section:

```nix
boot.kernelPackages = kernel-custom;
```

However, one problem with this setup is that any change to the `.config` or
kernel tree triggers Nix to rebuild the kernel. The rebuild happens because Nix
tries to make a clean build.

VM script which is created by `nix-build` command can use other kernel, not
built by `nix-build`. To achieve this do following:

0. Remove package which was defined above and `boot.kernelPackage` setting
1. Compile linux kernel as you usually do to get `bzImage`
2. Define hostname in your VM:

	```nix
	networking.hostName = "vm";
	```

3. `nix-build` the VM
4. Export environment variable with path to your kernel:

	```nix
	export NIXPKGS_QEMU_KERNEL_vm=/path/to/arch/x86/boot/bzImage
	```

	The name is `NIXPKGS_QEMU_KERNEL_<networking.hostName>`

5. Run the VM `./result/bin/run-vm-vm`

I've tried to use CCache with Nix to make its kernel build faster, but that
doesn't seem to work yet.

#### Network and SSH

TODO

#### Adding package to VM

This is as easy as:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
	htop
	util-linux
	xfstests
	vim
	tmux
	fsverity-utils
];
```

Adding overlay on top to build with your local changes and it becomes amazingly
easy to get a VM with custom environment. To add overlay:

```nix
nixpkgs.overlays = [ 
	xfstests-overlay-remote
];
```

#### Bypassing hardware to VM (USB, HDD)

To share partition with VM add an option to Qemu:

```nix
virtualisation.qemu.options = [
	"-hdc /dev/sda4"
	"-hdd /dev/sda5"
];
```
Or if you need just a dummy space you can add pre-allocated disk image or ask
Nix to create some empty partitions:

```nix
# Nix will create 2 virtual disks
virtualisation.emptyDiskImages = [ 8192 4096 ]; # Create 2 virtual disk with 8G and 4G

# Append images as partitions to VM
virtualisation.qemu.options.drives = [
	{ name = "vdc"; file = "${toString ./test.img}"; }
	{ name = "vdb"; file = "${toString ./scratch.img}"; }
];
```

To pass a USB device to VM add following configuration:

```nix
	TODO
```

#### Create a bootable ISO

Time to deploy the VM to cloud or other machine.

TODO

#### Tips & tricks to configure the VM

From now on we will configure our VM. The configuration in `vm.nix` is
configuration of the guest system. It can contains some host configuration
though.

Example of systemd service started on boot. You can do some setup in there.

```nix
# Do something after systemd started
systemd.services.foo = {
	serviceConfig.Type = "oneshot";
	wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
	script = ''
		echo 'This service runs right near login' > /dev/kmsg
	'';
};
```

Environment variable. To define environment variable use following expression:

	environment.variables.NAME = "thisisname";

Qemu options, shared directories, shared disks could be added in
`virtualization`. For this you will also need to import
`/virtualisation/qemu-vm.nix`.
