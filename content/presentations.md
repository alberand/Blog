During studying in the university I seen many technical presentation

Most of them were just some set or necessary facts for exams

Or even worse - list of mathematics equations or formulas to remember

Looking back on the learned concepts I made a few points of the better ways of
presenting information to the students

* starting from known
* building conceptual model 
* In engineering starting from the problem going to the solution
    * Using History of the solution
* Only after that connecting it to the existing framework

Good example:
    Don't learn programming framework first, but learn to program and start to
    solve the real problem
